## Waracle Cats Test

A sample web app built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) in Typescript using [The Cat API](http://thecatapi.com).

# Installation

```bash
npm i
```

# Configuration

API Keys are required to use the cat api. These are stored in the `.env.<environment>`
files in the project root. Currently the favourites feature uses a global user, also
configured in this environment file. A future enhancement would be to support multiple
users.

# Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

# Development

```bash
npm run develop
```
